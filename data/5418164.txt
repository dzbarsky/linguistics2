"Panera Bread Co. reported net income for the first quarter ended March 25, 2008 of $12 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, which included the impact of a charge of $0.06 per diluted share resulting from the Company's decision to raise its sales hurdles for new bakery-cafe development. The charge was approximately $2.7 million recorded in general and administrative expenses and related to previously capitalized development costs and lease expenses for certain of the sites the Company had elected not to open as part of its adjustment to its 2008 development plans. Net income was $15 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the first quarter ended March 27, 2007. Total revenue was $304,978,000 against total revenue of $239, 676,000 reported in the same period a year ago. The Company is increasing and narrowing its earnings per diluted share target for the second quarter of 2008 from a range of $0.37 to $0.43 to a range of $0.40 to $0.44, which would be an increase of 3% to 13% from second quarter 2007 results."
