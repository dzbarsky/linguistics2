Illumina Inc. Announces Shipment of HiScanSQ.
Illumina Inc. announced shipment of HiScanSQ, the first instrument to integrate microarray analysis and next-generation sequencing in a modular design that can evolve with changing research needs. HiScanSQ is designed for smaller core labs that don't want to purchase separate platforms to run sequencing and microarray experiments; groups that primarily run arrays but are looking to move into sequencing for the first time; and facilities that run both arrays and capillary electrophoresis sequencing and are looking to add high-throughput sequencing. The HiScanSQ system has two components: the HiScan Reader, a high-performance array scanner that can also image sequencing flow cells and the SQ Module, an add-on fluidics device that enables genomic-scale sequencing. The publication-proven HiScan Reader functions independently as a high-speed, precision micro-array scanner for Illumina's BeadArray products. With the SQ module, the system switches to perform Illumina's sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS), the most widely
