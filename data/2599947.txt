Genizon Adopts New Whole-Genome Genotyping Technology for its Disease Association Research.
Illumina Inc. announced that Genizon BioSciences is adopting Illumina's whole-genome genotyping technology for its disease association research program designed to understand the genetic basis of more than 20 common diseases. Using Illumina's Sentrix HumanHap300 BeadChips and Infinium assay, Genizon expects to conduct whole-genome association studies on at least 16,000 case and control samples in 11 common diseases over the next 12-18 months, adding to the 3 such studies already completed. To accommodate this initiative, Genizon will build out its existing Illumina system infrastructure with six additional BeadArray Readers, extensive automation, laboratory information management systems to integrate data workflows and ensure accurate sample tracking, and new BeadStudio software.
