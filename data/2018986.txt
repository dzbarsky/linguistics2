Announced Merger/Acquisition Transaction - Target: AES Kelvin Power Pty. Ltd.; Buyer(s): AES Corp.; Transaction Size: $23 mm.
The purchase price for the Kelvin Station is approximately $23 million, and is being acquired from the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality ("CJMM"), which will retain a 50% interest in AES Kelvin with shareholder rights limited to protecting the employment of workers for three years. AES Kelvin will receive 100% of distributions and have operating control of the plant. In addition to the purchase price, AES has committed to invest about $15 million in capital to refurbish the plant, including a new bag filtration system making it one of the cleanest plants in South Africa and expects to spend another $11 million for worker transition costs over the first three years of operation. AES expects to finance at least 50% of this acquisition with debt from South African banks in local currency. Fieldstone was the financial advisor to the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Council on the privatization.
