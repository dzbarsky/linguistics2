Genomas and Illumina Form Strategic Alliance on Physiogenomics of Metabolic Syndrome.
Illumina Inc. and Genomas Inc., a healthcare company developing products for personalized treatments of obesity and related metabolic disorders, announced a collaboration for the design and validation of gene marker panels. Under the agreement, Genomas will use the Illumina BeadStation 500GX for the discovery of diagnostic markers to be used in the development of PhysioTypes(TM). PhysioTypes are predictors incorporating haplotypes from various genes, baseline physiological and clinical information, and demographic data. Genomas will develop PhysioTypes for the prediction of an individual's response to exercise, diet and drug regimens to personalize prevention and treatment of obesity and the related metabolic syndrome leading to diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
