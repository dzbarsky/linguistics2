Fidelity National Information Services Announces Launch of Transax Merchant Services.
Fidelity National Information Services Inc. announced the launch of Transax Merchant Services-an aggressively priced credit and debit card payment service designed to help businesses improve their margins and quality of service at the point of sale (POS). Transax Merchant Services is seen as an alternative to credit and debit card services traditionally offered by banks and, more recently, by small Independent Sales organizations (ISOs) throughout the U.K. Built on its 22-year track record of helping merchants by making it easier for their customers to pay and alleviating concerns about credit risk, Transax Merchant Services is the next logical step in the development of secure and safe credit and debit card transactions at the point of sale.
