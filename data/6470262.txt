Molex Introduces Modular High-Current Power and Signal Connector System with 60.0A per Blade Rating.
Molex Inc. introduced a high-power connector that can reach a current rating of 60.0A per blade at a 30? T-rise. Molex's EXTreme Ten60Power(TM) family offers a higher current density and a lower profile than any competing product. Designed for use in power supplies, servers, routers, one and two rack unit (RU) modular enclosures, chassis-based systems, storage and industrial controllers, the EXTreme Ten60Power family features a modular high-current power and signal connector system in a coplanar and right-angle board-to-board orientation. It also provides a maximum current-to-space ratio packaged in a low profile, 10.00mm (.394') tall housing design that enhances system airflow. The EXTreme Ten60Power family's high-current contact blades in DC (5.50mm) and AC (7.50mm) spacing options provide design flexibility. Power blades are rated up to 60.0A per blade, providing up to 260.0A per linear inch of board real estate. Both the plug and receptacle utilize reliable, proven Molex power and signal contact designs.
