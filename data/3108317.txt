Affymetrix Inc. announced that District Court Judge Joseph J. Farnan of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware issued a Markman order in the litigation brought by Affymetrix against Illumina Inc. Affymetrix has accused Illumina of infringing U.S. Patent Nos. 6,355,432, 6,646,243, 5,545,531, 6,399,365, and 5,795,716 (patents-in-suit). In a Markman decision, the District Court interprets disputed claim language. The Court's August 16 Order addressed 15 disputed claim terms in the five patents-in-suit. The Court agreed with Affymetrix' proposed constructions for most terms and adopted only two of Illumina's proposed constructions.
