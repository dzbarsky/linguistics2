Cadence Design Systems Inc. Leverages New Miniaturization Capabilities to Advance PCB Design Leadership.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced the latest release of its Cadence(R) Allegro(R) and OrCAD(R) printed circuit board (PCB) software, with new features and functionality designed to boost productivity and performance for PCB engineers. The Allegro and OrCAD PCB Design Release 16.3 brings PCB engineers significant new benefits, including the ability to miniaturize the footprint of their end product and reduce the number of physical prototype iterations, making the design cycle more predictable. This release addresses increased functional and interconnect density through improvements for rigid-flex routing, extended high-density interconnect (HDI) rules, 3D viewing of PCBs and asymmetrical clearance for RF circuits. Extended micro via stacking rules allow users to create the most difficult HDI designs, and multi-line curved bus routing that hugs the flex outline accelerates the creation of rigid-flex designs. Additionally, an integrated 3D PCB viewer gives designers visibility into components and HDI micro v
