IIJ Technology Selects Brocade San Directors to Expand its Data Management Service.
Brocade Communications Systems Inc. announced that IIJ Technology (IIJ-Tech) selected Brocade 48000 Directors to build its innovative 3-tier Storage Area Network (SAN) to provide a much more flexible IT foundation for delivering its Integration and Business Platform Service (IBPS) data management service. The deployment allows IIJ-Tech to flexibly and quickly offer the service, responding to its customers' data management needs in the most efficient manner possible. IIJ-Tech's IBPS provides enterprise customers with IT infrastructure services, including networks, servers, and storage. When IIJ-Tech extensively renovated IBPS in 2003, the company expanded its network by building a core- edge SAN that centrally managed data traffic between servers.
