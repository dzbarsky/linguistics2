Illumina Announces Broad Commercialization of Two Sequencing-Based Applications for Gene Expression Analysis.
Illumina Inc. announced the broad commercial release of two Digital Gene Expression (DGE) applications that use company's Genome Analyzer to generate genome-wide sequencing-based expression profiles of messenger and small RNA. These Digital Gene Expression applications, which have been in Early Access testing and evaluation since February 2007, offer researchers a robust platform for novel RNA discovery, accurate quantification of low-abundance messenger RNA, and measurement of gene expression in any species without the need for prior sequence knowledge. Digital Gene Expression for Small RNA Analysis is a universal application that supports researchers interested in the discovery of all forms of small non-coding RNA from any organism. Using the Solexa Sequencing technology, this approach has the ability to analyze up to four million small RNAs simultaneously in one sample.
