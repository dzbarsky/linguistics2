Kgel Fahrzeugwerke Simplifies and Optimises File Storage with Brocade File Lifecycle Management Solution.
Brocade Communications Systems Inc. announced that Kgel Fahrzeugwerke has streamlined storage of its vital business files. Brocade FLM enabled the Burtenbach, Germany-based firm to implement a two-tiered storage strategy, making its file data environment more efficient by storing only its most important files on its primary Networked Attached Storage (NAS) devices. Kgel Fahrzeugwerke's need for a file management solution stemmed from its deployment of a high-end, NAS filer from NetApp for high-performance storage and a less-costly NetApp platform for high-capacity storage. Administrators installed Brocade FLM and defined policies for file relocation, with last accessed time being a primary criterion, thereby non-disruptively moving all files meeting the policy criteria to the low-cost secondary NetApp platform, freeing up capacity on the high-end filer. The Brocade FLM solution leaves metadata for all moved files on the primary device, enabling Brocade FLM to retrieve files from the secondary system upon user
