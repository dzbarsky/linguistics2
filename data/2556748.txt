Cephalon Inc. Provides Update on Regulatory Status of SPARLON(TM) Tablets.
Cephalon Inc. announced that it does not expect final action from the FDA on its pending new drug application for SPARLON(TM) (modafinil) Tablets [C-IV] for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents until after the completion of several FDA advisory committee meetings. The first two panels, scheduled for February 9, 2006 and March 22, 2006, will consider safety and risk management issues associated with products in the class of currently approved ADHD treatments. Since SPARLON is not an approved drug, it will not be discussed at these meetings. A separate advisory panel to review SPARLON has been scheduled for March 23, 2006. On October 20, 2005, the FDA issued an approvable letter with respect to the company's NDA for SPARLON. The company now expects to launch SPARLON during the second quarter of 2006.
