Brocade Communications Systems Inc. Launches New Server Management.
Brocade Communications Systems Inc. announced that it has launched new server management and wide area file services tools. The new offerings and their Tapestry brand name mark something of a sea change at Brocade, which until now has focused tightly on SAN switching hardware. The firm's Silkworm brand of SAN switches is one of the leaders in the storage infrastructure market. Brocade's Tapestry Application Resource Manager (ARM) is a software module that runs on Brocade's new Intelligent Application Platform. Uli Plechschmidt, Brocade vice-president, said Tapestry ARM manages the relationship between server hardware, applications, operating system and storage.
