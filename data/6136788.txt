AK Steel Holding Corp. to Lay Off 45 Workers in Middletown.
AK Steel Holding Corp. will lay off about 45 workers at its Middletown Works. Twenty-two workers will be laid off next week, and another 20-25 a week or two later, citing an official with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local Lodge 1943. Lower demand for AK Steel's products prompted the layoffs. The steelmaker had exempted its Middletown operation from layoffs up to this point. In November, it halted production and shipping at its 365-worker Mansfield plant, and blast furnace and steelmaking, casting and coating operations at its Ashland, Ky., mill. Most of those workers still have not been called back. In early December AK Steel said it would impose a 5% pay cut on its salaried work force, including the CEO and executive officers.
