Illumina Introduces the Infinium HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced the introduction of the Infinium HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip, the Company's fourth multi-sample DNA Analysis solution for genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The HumanHap550-Duo provides the same content as the HumanHap550 BeadChip in a dual-sample format, resulting in significantly greater throughput and lower cost per sample. The introduction of the HumanHap550-Duo is another example of Illumina's overall strategy to leverage the flexibility of the BeadArray?technology to drive down the per sample cost while providing customers with high quality and product performance. The HumanHap550-Duo provides the same content as the single-sample HumanHap550. The HumanHap550-Duo is priced between $290 and $370 per sample, depending on volume, while the Human1M BeadChip is priced between $580 and $650. The Human1M is the only product to offer more than one million SNPs and unequaled novel and known CNV content on a single BeadChip.
