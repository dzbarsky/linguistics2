Big Lots partners with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to help foster positive life values.
Big Lots Inc., known for its closeout shopping values, has joined forces with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to help foster positive life values for the nation's youth. Boys & Girls Clubs provide supervised and structured educational, athletic and social programs to more than three million young people each year. As part of Big Lots' commitment, the company has launched a program called Values for Life that will help B&GCA construct state-of-the-art learning centers and renovate existing ones in B&GCs around the country. The learning centers will offer young people a place to do homework, use computers and participate in educational activities after school and on weekends -- whenever kids have free time and need positive, productive outlets.
