Cadence Design Systems Inc. Expands SoC Design Alliance with Toshiba Corporation.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that it has extended and expanded the scope of its recently announced relationship with Toshiba Corporation for COT (customer-owned tooling) and SoC design targeting the growing and increasingly complex mobile and consumer markets. This new broader relationship will include technologies such as chip planning of early-stage SoC designs utilizing Cadence(R) Chip Planning system, DRC/LVS/ERC using the Cadence Physical Verification System, and acceleration of mixed signal design simulations with parallel processing utilizing Cadence Virtuoso(R) Advanced Parallel Simulator. Integration of the Virtuoso custom IC design environment with the Encounter(R) Digital Implementation System provides a significant flow and methodology advantage for hierarchical A/D floor planning, routing, electrical analysis, ECOs, and final chip finishing.
