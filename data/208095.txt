AK Steel Files Motion To Collect Attorney Fees and Interest From USWA.
AK Steel Holding Corporation reported that it has filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Cleveland seeking nearly $1 million in attorneys fees and expenses from the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) international union and its Local 169 in Mansfield, Ohio. The motion, filed, follows a federal jury's award on November 1, 2002, of nearly $4.4 million to AK Steel after an eight-person jury found the international and local union responsible for a concerted work slowdown and a mob riot against the company in 1999. AK Steel was represented by Frost Brown Todd LLC in the case.
