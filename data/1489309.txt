Illumina Inc. Announces Availability of Its New Product.
Illumina Inc. announced the commercial availability of its new DASL (cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, extension and Ligation) assay for generating reproducible gene expression profiles from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and other samples containing partially degraded RNAs. The DASL assay enables researchers to measure RNA abundance of over 500 genes in parallel per sample. The assay probes three unique sequences per target gene and PCR amplification is limited to genes of interest, resulting in high specificity and sensitivity when hybridized and detected on Illumina's Sentrix Arrays. Illumina also released a standard DASL cancer panel.
