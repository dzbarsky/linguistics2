"The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. announced earnings results for the second quarter of 2007. Net income for the quarter rose to $277.1 million, or 79 cents per share, from $221 million, or 60 cents per share for the same period last year. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $1.72 billion from $1.53 billion. Foreign exchange rates boosted revenue by $16.8 million but had no material impact on operating profit growth. The company said its second-quarter profit rose 25% on strong results at its financial services division. The company reaffirmed earnings guidance for the year 2007. Looking ahead, the company said it still expects double-digit earnings growth in 2007 even though the growth rate will probably slow during the second half of the year from the 'very strong' first half of the year."
