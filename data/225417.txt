Utility Company AES to Divulge Debt Restructuring Solution.
The AES Corp. is expected to announce the results of its offer to restructure $500 million worth of debt, with the possibility of bankruptcy hanging in the balance. If 80 percent of the bondholders agree to swap their existing notes for a combination of cash and new notes, AES, the parent of Indianapolis Power & Light Co., would not have to default on the first $300 million of debt, which comes due Dec. 15, and would improve its chances of avoiding bankruptcy.
