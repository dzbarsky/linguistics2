Cadence and Denali Team Up to Enable Advanced DDR-PHY Methodology.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Denali Software Inc. announced that they have delivered an advanced DDR-PHY implementation methodology based on the Cadence(R) Encounter(R) digital IC design platform. This new methodology uses Cadence SoC Encounter(TM) RTL-to-GSDII system for design and physical implementation and Cadence Encounter Timing System for design closure and final timing, signal integrity and signoff -- both are key technologies of the CPF-enabled Encounter platform. Using the combination of Denali's Databahn DDR controller and PHY IP with the Encounter technologies, customers can now achieve DDR memory-system implementations at 65 nanometers and at speeds exceeding 400 MHz. This methodology combines innovative design techniques, and world-class implementation and analysis solutions enabling robust customer design kits, or complete IP hardening leading to the market's smallest and highest performance configurable DDR-PHY products. An estimated 70% of new SoC designs use DDR-memory-subsystem IP. DDR m
