Harsco Corp. announced that its industry-leading MultiServ mill services division has been awarded multi-year contracts in Australia, Italy and the UK that include close to $15 million in combined new revenues over their terms. MultiServ has received a seven-year contract extension from OneSteel at its operations in Victoria, Australia that includes new responsibilities for a range of melt shop and property services previously handled by outside contractors. The contract adds to a nearly 20-year MultiServ presence at this location, a former Smorgon Steel operation. Smorgon recently merged with OneSteel to form Australia's leading manufacturer of steel long products.
