Grace Semiconductor Adopts Cadence Virtuoso 6.1 PDK Development System.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation as adopted Cadence(R) Virtuoso(R) 6.1 technology for developing and testing process design kits (PDK's). The Cadence Virtuoso 6.1 PDK Automation System, or PAS, aids in the efficient creation of PDK's, while the System for Testing PDK's, or STEP, enables quality assurance of PDK's. Using PAS and STEP, Grace Semiconductor has developed and validated its 0.18-micron mixed-signal, RF PDK, which is now available for its global customers. The PAS and STEP technologies are used to create and test PDK's which enable the Cadence Virtuoso custom IC design platform, including the IC 6.1 releases of Virtuoso and the Analog Mixed-Signal Methodology Kit. PAS comprises a unique graphical technology editor, verification run-set generators, PCell generators and the DFII library builder. The differentiated technology significantly reduces PDK development time and maintenance costs by capturing and maintaining PDK-related data in a single
