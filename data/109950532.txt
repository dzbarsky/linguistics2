Illumina Inc. Announces Launch of Eco(TM) Real-Time PCR System.
Illumina Inc. announced the Eco Real-Time PCR System, a novel platform that promises to extend the access of real-time PCR applications to the individual bench scientist. The Eco system sets new standards in performance and simplicity for qPCR, while offering unprecedented access to a wide range of applications at one-quarter of the price of other commercially available, similarly featured, real-time PCR systems. The Eco Real-Time PCR System offers true four-color multiplexing and High-Resolution Melting Analysis (HRM); use of all standard Real-Time PCR chemistries, and ability to perform fast PCR using standard chemistries; data quality and reproducibility with well-to-well uniformity five times that of other commercially-available, far more costly Real-Time PCR systems; compact (approximately one cubic foot) design and 48-well plate format specifically tailored to the needs of the individual researcher; ease of use and installation by both experienced and novice Real-Time PCR users; an intuitive, icon-drive
