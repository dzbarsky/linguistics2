Illumina Mulls Acquisitions.
Illumina Inc. held its earnings conference call. The company intends to look at acquisition opportunities. Jay Flatley, President and CEO of the company said: On the R&D side, we continue to run lots of programs in parallel. There's no very significant individual major investment that we expect to be incremental there, although we've always said as we get to these levels of operating profit that we would look for opportunities, if they're out there, to make investments in things that will continue to push the high end growth of the Company, including potential acquisitions.
