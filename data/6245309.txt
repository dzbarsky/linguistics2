Harsco's Infrastructure Group Expands Market Presence with Three New International Contract Awards.
Harsco Corp. announced its receipt of three new international awards by its Harsco Infrastructure group totaling more than $1.5 million, including awards in two of Harsco's newest international markets, Romania and Peru. In Romania, Harsco has won an order to supply rental concrete formwork during the modernization of Romania's power station, the CET Turceni plant. The facility is the thermal power plant in Romania and one of the in Europe, generating about 10% of Romania's domestic electricity consumption. Harsco has also been selected to provide rental formwork to a new office building near Paris, working with French construction giant Eiffage, with whom Harsco also collaborated last year for the construction of France's second hospital. Harsco's formwork will be used during construction of the office tower's cast-in-place concrete walls, floors and ceilings. Work is scheduled to begin next month.
