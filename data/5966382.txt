Cadence Encounter Test Helps Hitachi Improve Product Quality and Lower Manufacturing Test Cost.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that its unique test technologies have enabled Hitachi Ltd., in the hardware domain of Information & Telecommunication Systems, to cost-effectively produce high-performance large scale integrated circuit (LSI) devices in volume with the lowest number of test escapes or defects achieved by Hitachi to date. By combining Cadence(R) Encounter(R) Test pattern-fault modeling with the test pattern generation, compression technology and diagnostics, Cadence helps Hitachi ensure that these complex, high-performance LSI devices work as designed. Working together, Cadence and Hitachi have significantly advanced LSI device quality through innovative test methodologies. By combining Cadence's unique pattern fault modeling technology, SDF-based dynamic test generation, and OPMISR+compression with Hitachi's test methodology, the two companies produced test vector compression results exceeding 300X.
