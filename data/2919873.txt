Hansen Natural Open to Being Acquired.
Hansen Natural Corp. could be open to being acquired in the interest of shareholders if the right offer was made, Chief Executive Rodney Sacks said on May 24. Speaking in New York at the Beverage Forum, an industry conference, Sacks also said that the energy drinks category in the United States was not seeing any pricing pressure. "Retailers are in fact taking pricing up and there is no resistance from the consumer," Sacks said. Talking about the offers he has received to being acquired, Sacks said that although he is in no rush he could sell his company to someone making the right bid.
