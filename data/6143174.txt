Illumina Inc. Announces High Density Expansion to iSelect(R) Custom Genotyping Platform.
Illumina Inc. launched the Infinium(R) HD (High Density) iSelect Custom Genotyping solution. Researchers now have the flexibility to screen SNPs ranging from 3,000 to 200,000 in focused genotyping studies for both human and non-human species. This higher-density iSelect Custom Genotyping technology is the most versatile solution of its kind in the industry. It offers high data quality, high-throughput capabilities, and flexible sample multiplexing to screen any SNP in any species. The first commercially available products made with the Infinium HD iSelect technology include the OvineSNP50 and PorcineSNP60 BeadChips. These 12-sample SNP genotyping products add to Illumina's expanding agriculture portfolio, helping researchers detect genome-wide genetic variation in any breed of pig or sheep. The new panels were developed in collaboration with leading researchers at international consortia and utilized Illumina's Genome Analyzer, public databases, and other marker discovery approaches for content selection.
