Polysack and Avery Dennison Enter into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement.
Avery Dennison Corporation announced that its Roll Materials division has entered into a collaboration agreement with Polysack Plastic Industries Ltd. to exclusively distribute and sell Polysack's Polyphane(TM) Fit roll-fed shrink films in the United States, Canada Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. The deal is the first distribution arrangement Avery Dennison has established with another label material supplier. Roll-fed shrink films are one of the fastest-growing label decorating technologies, providing the benefit of shrink sleeves at a lower cost. Polysack developed a range of products with a shrink ratio from 15% up to 50% that can be applied to traditional roll-fed labeling using hot-melt or UV glue and advanced technologies such as laser and ultrasonic welding. Under the agreement, Avery Dennison will provide sales, distribution, marketing and customer support for Polysack's portfolio of roll-fed shrink films.
