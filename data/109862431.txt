Illumina Inc. Announces the Launch of its TruSeq SBS Sequencing Kit.
Illumina Inc. announced the launch of its TruSeq SBS Sequencing kit that will enable high-quality paired end reads of 150 base pairs (bp), increase the output of high-quality base calls, and enhance throughput to greater than 95 Gigabases (Gb) of high-quality base pairs per run on Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) sequencing system. The kit, which the company has commenced shipping broadly, is the first in a series of new kits that will further advance data quality, ease of use and economical sequencing on the company's sequencing platforms. Individual products within the family of TruSeq reagents will be specifically formulated for each Illumina sequencing platform to best leverage the features of that system to provide the highest yield and quality of data. Coupled with advances in algorithms, the TruSeq SBS Sequencing kit will enable researchers to increase the yield of Q30 base calls and generate approximately 500 million perfect reads per 2x100 bp run, setting a new standard for output of high-quality data
