Nethra Enlists Cadence Incisive Palladium Accelerator/Emulator to Speed Development of Advanced HD Image Processor.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that Nethra Imaging Inc. reduced the development time of a high-definition (HD) image processor design using the Cadence(R) Incisive(R) Palladium(R) II Accelerator/Emulator. Productivity improvements that Nethra experienced with the Palladium product enabled the company to boost design quality and confidence while meeting an ambitious development deadline. The adoption and rapid deployment of the Palladium II system for the HD image processor ASIC containing more than 25 million gates enabled Nethra's engineering team to accelerate system-level verification for a leading-edge camera application. According to Nethra, system-level and subsystem verification was able to achieve 507KHz to 1.3MHz, depending on runtime environments and conditions. With simulation only, verification ran at about 30Hz; accelerated with the Palladium system, Nethra achieved an increase in acceleration 4 orders higher in magnitude at the full chip level. In addition, the Palladium system's producti
