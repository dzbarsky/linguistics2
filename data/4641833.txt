Illumina Announces Multi-Million Dollar Collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, the Broad Institute, and the CARe Consortium to Develop a Customized SNP Panel for Vascular Disease.
Illumina Inc. announced a large-scale collaboration with the Institute of Translational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the Broad Institute, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Candidate-gene Association REsource (CARe) Consortium to develop a customized chip for vascular disease. Called the IBC (ITMAT, Broad, CARe) chip, this array will be developed to analyze more than 55,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes selected for cardiovascular and other associated phenotypes. Employing Illumina's iSelect Custom Genotyping BeadChip, researchers will assess the genetic diversity within pathways of approximately 2,100 genes believed to underpin primary and secondary vascular disease processes, such as blood pressure, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, insulin resistance, metabolic disorders, dyslipidemia (changes in lipid levels in the blood), and inflammation. The content for the custom array was chosen based on pu
