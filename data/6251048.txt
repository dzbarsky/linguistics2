Cadence Extends the Open Verification Methodology Beyond SystemVerilog to Include SystemC and e Language Support.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced the release of open source libraries for e and SystemC languages to support the Open Verification Methodology (OVM). The OVM was originally developed for SystemVerilog; the Cadence contribution enables the development of OVM-compliant verification components and testbenches in any of the three IEEE-standard languages used for verification and modeling: SystemVerilog, e, and SystemC. The OVM was architected from the beginning with multi-language verification in mind. By using transaction-level modeling (TLM) channels as the basis for communication, OVM SystemVerilog verification components can communicate easily with existing e and SystemC components without changing those existing methodologies. The new libraries allow verification engineers to develop new components and testbenches in any of the three languages, using corresponding library elements with the same methodology and reuse guidelines.
