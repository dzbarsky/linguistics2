Firehouse Road Associates II LLC Files Lawsuit Against Starbucks Corp.
Chris Abele, president of Abele Builders announced that he is suing Starbucks Corp. after the company backed out of a deal to lease space for a new coffee shop. Abele Builders spent about $800,000 to construct a building with a drive-thru on Northside Drive near Route 146 in Clifton Park. The 4,000-square-foot building includes 1,800 square feet that Starbucks had agreed to lease last year. The exterior is finished and the landscaping is nearly complete. The company learned over the summer Starbucks wouldn't be leasing the space. A subsidiary of Abele Builders, Firehouse Road Associates II LLC, filed a lawsuit against Starbucks in state Supreme Court in Saratoga County.
