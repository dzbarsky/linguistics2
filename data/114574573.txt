Elecnor S.A Selects Fluor Corporation to Design Two Solar Power Plants in Spain.
Elecnor S.A. has awarded Fluor Corporation an engineering services contract for two new 50MW concentrating solar power plants in Alcazar de San Juan, Spain. Fluor will provide basic and detailed engineering and other associated services for these two new solar units. When complete, the two 50MW concentrating solar power (CSP) generating facilities will capture solar energy using parabolic trough mirrors and will ultimately convert the energy into electricity through a steam turbine generator. The project is under way with engineering expected to be complete by the third quarter of 2011. Fluor's Asturias and Madrid, Spain, operations will lead the engineering effort with support from its southern California operations center.
