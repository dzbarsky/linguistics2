Starbucks Launches New Automatic Reload Option for Starbucks Card.
"Starbucks Coffee Co. continues to improve customer convenience with the introduction of Automatic Reload to the Starbucks Card. Designed to easily replenish Card balances, this new service is the latest enhancement to the Starbucks Card payment platform, and is another example of how the Card can help Starbucks customers simplify their daily lives. Automatic Reload gives Starbucks customers the opportunity to replenish their Starbucks Card balances with a credit or debit card. Customers can set a minimum balance threshold for their Cards and when the account falls below the threshold, it is automatically replenished through the customer's designated credit or debit card."
