Atheros Communications Introduces First Single-chip PCI Express(TM) Compliant Wireless LAN Solutions.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the world's first complete single-chip IEEE 802.11a/g (Atheros AR5006EX) and 802.11g (Atheros AR5006EG) WLAN solutions with support for PCI Express(TM). The chips integrate an entire WLAN solution-media access controller (MAC), baseband processor, and a high-performance 2.4/5-GHz radio or 2.4-GHz radio-in a low-cost digital CMOS design. With this high level of integration, the AR5006EX and AR5006EG enable the entire WLAN solution to fit on a single-sided mini card or ExpressCard design, creating the ideal choice for aftermarket and embedded WLAN solutions for personal computers. These designs exploit the ability of the PCI Express bus architecture to support high-performance computing with up to 2.5-gigabit-per-second transmit and receive rates-a 150% improvement over the existing PCI architecture.
