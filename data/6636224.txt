Amazon.com Inc. Files Patent Suit Against Discovery Communications, Inc.
Amazon.com Inc. has filed a lawsuit against Discovery Communications Inc. alleging it infringed four of Amazon's e-commerce patents. The suit alleges infringement of patents covering search engine and recommendation technology by an e-commerce site run by Discovery Communications Inc. The suit was filed last week in US District Court in Seattle. Amazon's suit comes after Discovery filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the Seattle, Washington-based online retail company in March over its popular electronic reader, the Kindle. Discovery, in the suit filed in a US District Court in Delaware, claimed Amazon violated a patent it registered in November 2007, and said the Kindle infringes Discovery's intellectual property rights. Discovery said Kindle violates its development of a digital rights management scheme--the way Amazon protects the books it sells for the handheld product. Amazon had filed counterclaims in connection with Discovery's suit.
