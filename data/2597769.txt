Atheros Communications Inc. Announces a Collaboration with QUALCOMM Inc. to Develop Interoperability between Atheros' Highly Integrated, Single-Chip Radio-on-Chip for Mobile Solution.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced a collaboration with QUALCOMM Inc. to develop interoperability between Atheros' highly integrated, single-chip Radio-on-Chip for Mobile(TM) (ROCm) solution and select QUALCOMM Mobile Station Modem(TM) (MSM(TM)) chipsets. The ROCm solution will initially interoperate with the MSM6550(TM) for CDMA2000(R) networks and the MSM6280(TM) chipset for WCDMA (UMTS) networks. The combined solutions will enable cellular devices to support 802.11g and 802.11a/g wireless LAN (WLAN) technology. The initial interoperable Atheros ROCm and QUALCOMM MSM solution will be demonstrated next week at 3GSM in Barcelona and is scheduled to be commercially available by June 2006.
