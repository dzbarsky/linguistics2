Brocade and Ciena Team to Extend Power of Networked Storage.
Brocade Communications Systems Inc. and Ciena Corporation announced a plan to provide fully-tested Storage Area Network solutions over Metro and Wide Area Networks. The alliance provides enterprises with additional options to extend SANs using a wide range of MANs and WANs, and gives organizations the ability to implement BC/DR solutions with the best possible cost structure for each deployment scenario. By combining the market's leading 4 Gbit/sec SAN directors and switches from Brocade with Ciena's CN 4200(TM) FlexSelect(TM) Advanced Services Platform or CN 2000(R) Storage Extension Platform, organizations can implement high-performance links between remote sites while maximizing throughput and reducing WAN bandwidth costs. Customers can select the solution that best fits their requirements, and realize superior price/performance benefits in distance extension applications that utilize Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), SONET/SDH and Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) technologies.
