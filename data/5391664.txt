Illumina Announces the HumanHT-12 Gene Expression BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. introduced the HumanHT-12 BeadChip, a twelve sample product designed to accelerate whole genome expression and expression-based Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies. The HumanHT-12 BeadChip includes over 48,000 probes per sample and is priced at $75, supporting a total cost of $100 per sample including labeling reagents. Illumina expects to commence shipment of this new product in the second quarter 2008. The HumanHT-12 BeadChip is a powerful new product that will enable high-throughput whole-genome expression and eQTL analysis at exceptional price points. Along with the HumanWG-6, which offers the industry's highest quality whole-genome expression data, the HumanHT-12 will provide gene expression researchers with the most flexible and cost effective screening tool. The introduction of the HumanHT-12 BeadChip further enhances Illumina's suite of gene expression products, which includes sequencing-based assays for discovery and typing of transcripts, alternative splice forms, and small and micr
