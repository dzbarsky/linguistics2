Affymetrix Files Second Wave of Patent Infringement Lawsuits Against Illumina Inc.
Affymetrix Inc. announced that it has filed additional patent infringement lawsuits against Illumina Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, in the U.K. High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court and in the German D?sseldorf Regional Court, Patent Division. Affymetrix is seeking all available remedies, including injunctive relief. The new suits target technology offered by Solexa, the company acquired by Illumina in January 2007, as well as all of Illumina's BeadArray(TM) products. Affymetrix also filed new lawsuits in Germany and the U.K. because the infringing acts extend beyond the U.S. market.
