Local Group May Bid For The Boston Globe.
Retired General Electric chief executive Jack Welch and advertising executive Jack Connors may offer to buy The Boston Globe from The New York Times Co., the Globe reported on October 25th, citing several unnamed executives who have participated in the discussions. The Globe said neither Welch nor Connors would comment and said its sources have cautioned that the plans are preliminary. The newspaper said the executives are working with investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase to evaluate a potential deal, and that JPMorgan has valued the Globe at $550 million to $600 million, below the $1.1 billion the Times Co. paid in 1993. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment to the Globe. The Times Co. has said the Globe, despite its continued weak financial results, is not for sale.
