MTG Not Eyeing Alfa's CTC Media Stake.
Modern Times Group Mtg AB (MTG) is not planning to acquire Alfa Group's stake in CTC Media Inc. or any of the assets of News Corp in Eastern Europe, its chief executive, Hans Holger Albrecht said. Hans Holger Albrecht told Reuters that his group was concentrating on Africa for growth after 2011 when its current core markets may start to slow. When asked whether MTG might acquire Alfa's 26% stake in CTC Media, Albrecht replied: "No." MTG owns 40% of CTC. "We have a partnership that's very good. They have no intention to sell," he added in an interview. Kommersant reported earlier this year that Alfa Group may sell its stake to MTG or swap them for a stake in the group. Albrecht added that MTG had no interest in acquiring News Corp's TV stations in Bulgaria or Latvia, and believed they were no longer for sale. "I think that's all pulled back, as far as I know. They're not selling it any more, rumors are saying," he said.
