Cadence First Encounter Selected by Faraday for the Design of Advanced System-on-Chips.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that Faraday Technology Corporation has selected Cadence First Encounter Ultra for physical prototyping of its system on-a-chip designs. Faraday is a long time user of the Cadence Design Planner physical floorplanning tool. The company will use First Encounter, a key nanometer technology included in the Encounter system, to ensure design success and shorter time-to-market for its end customers. Faraday design engineers will employ a continuous convergence design methodology, using First Encounter Ultra to quickly generate and rapidly refine an accurate virtual prototype of the physical design. This provides fast feedback on chip performance and a fully functional, physically feasible layout down to the wire level. First Encounter Ultra bridges the gap between logic design and physical implementation. It will help Faraday's design teams produce a signoff-quality floor plan and placement optimized for rapid, reliable design closure.
