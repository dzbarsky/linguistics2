Principal Financial Group Eyes Acquisitions.
Principal Financial Group Inc. might plan to make acquisitions. Larry Zimpleman, CEO and President of the firm said, As details emerge, we are evaluating our options and considering our strategy to utilize these additional sources of capital flexibility. Importantly, there is an opportunistic element to our strategy. It encompasses organic sales growth, as well as acquisitions, where we see a growing number of prospects, particularly in asset management and international retirement services, two of the Company's three growth engines. Additional capital cushion will help position us to capitalize on these organic growth and acquisition opportunities.
