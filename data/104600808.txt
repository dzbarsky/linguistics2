Dolby Laboratories Inc. announced a collaboration that will see Nokia Corp. incorporate Dolby surround sound technologies into select handsets worldwide. The two companies revealed their collaboration following the launch of the Nokia(R) N8, Nokia's latest smart phone based on the Symbian^3 platform, and the world's first smart phone to incorporate Dolby(R) Digital Plus 5.1 surround sound technology. The collaboration between Nokia and Dolby now brings cinema-like experiences to mobile.
