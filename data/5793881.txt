Beijing Genomics Institute Signs Multi-Million Dollar Order with Illumina Inc. for 11 Additional Illumina Genome Analyzers.
Illumina Inc. announced that in early March Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) purchased 11 Genome Analyzers, increasing the organization's total number of the Illumina sequencing systems to 17. BGI is the fourth genome center to expand its Genome Analyzer install base to double digits. As a result of recent enhancements to the Genome Analyzer, BGI researchers will have the capacity to sequence more than two human genomes to 25x coverage per week. This significant increase in throughput will expand BGI's capacity for sequencing services to the local genetic research labs, as well as broaden the range and pace of sequencing projects undertaken by the organization, such as the YangHuang 99 project, the 1000 Genomes Project, the Giant Panda Project, the tree of life project, and numerous other large-scale initiatives.
