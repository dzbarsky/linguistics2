Cephalon Inc. Announces the Availability of NUVIGIL for the Treatment of Excessive Sleepiness Associated with Treated Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Shift Work Disorder and Narcolepsy.
Cephalon Inc. announced that NUVIGIL(R) (armodafinil) Tablets [C-IV], a longer-lasting formulation of modafinil, is now available. NUVIGIL is indicated to improve wakefulness throughout the day for the millions of patients who struggle with excessive sleepiness associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea, shift work sleep disorder, also known as shift work disorder, and narcolepsy. Cephalon has finalized the commercialization plans for NUVIGIL and, beginning immediately, any patient with a NUVIGIL prescription should be able to obtain the medication from their pharmacy or have it filled within 24 hours. Cephalon is also exploring the potential for NUVIGIL to treat the symptoms associated with an array of medical disorders. The company recently announced results from a phase three clinical trial of NUVIGIL as a treatment for patients with excessive sleepiness associated with jet lag disorder. Those data are expected to be submitted as part of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) later this year.
