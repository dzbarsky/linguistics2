Silicon Hive Utilizes Cadence Palladium III Solution for Highest Quality IP for Multi-Core Multi-Million Gate Designs.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that Silicon Hive, achieved the highest quality for its HiveGo mobile imaging and video decoding solutions using the Cadence(r) Palladium(r) III Accelerator/Emulator. Palladium technology enabled Silicon Hive to meet aggressive IP quality requirements for multi-core, multi-million-gate designs targeting mass-market consumer products. Both companies cooperated on the integration of Palladium transaction-based acceleration (TBA) technology into Silicon Hive's development flow. TBA allowed the design team to fully validate its RTL IP by running the complete video decoding software on the Palladium system including external system interaction. Transaction-based acceleration (TBA) helps design and verification teams reduce their verification time by providing new infrastructure and guidelines to support a reusable accelerated verification environment running at close to emulation speed. Silicon Hive estimated the execution speed of Palladium III to be up to100 frames of H.264
