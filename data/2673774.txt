AK Steel Holding Corp. and Union Agree to Resume Negotiations.
AK Steel Holding Corp. and the union that represents 2,700 workers at the company's Middletown Works agreed to resume negotiations to try to end a three-day lockout. The two sides had not met since the old labor agreement expired, when members of the Armco Employees Independent Federation were locked out of the integrated steel plant about 30 miles north of Cincinnati. Replacement workers and salaried employees have staffed the plant since then. AK Steel has said it must cut labor costs to be competitive. It contends it is burdened with labor costs including obligations to retirees, such as pensions, that add $40 to $50 a ton more than their competitors' labor costs for production. The company's last proposal would have allowed the company to reduce the workforce, slash the number of job classifications in the plant, freeze pensions and charge workers some of the cost of their health care insurance.
