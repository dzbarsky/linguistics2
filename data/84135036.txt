Illumina Introduces the HumanOmniExpress BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced the HumanOmniExpress BeadChip (OmniExpress), the newest addition to the Omni family of microarrays for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Designed as a 12-sample Beadchip, OmniExpress allows interrogation of over 700,000 variants per sample totaling more than eight million available data points on a single chip. Coupled with the Illumina iScan System, OmniExpress enables processing of more than 1,400 samples per week, the highest throughput in the industry. The markers on OmniExpress are a subset of the content powering Illumina's GWAS product, the HumanOmni1-Quad, and incorporate an optimized set of SNPs chosen from all three phases of the International HapMap Project. As with the HumanOmni1, researchers starting with OmniExpress can take advantage of future supplemental Omni BeadChips containing new content derived from the 1,000 Genomes Project. Priced at $250 (USD) per sample, OmniExpress offers a compelling entry point to the next generation of Illumina Omni arrays. The combi
