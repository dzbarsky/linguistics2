AK Steel Announces Disagreement with Union Workers.
AK Steel Holding Corp. and its union workers disagreed over the company's demand that it be able to reduce the work force, freeze pensions and require employees to pay more of their health costs, among other issues. Union members had recently voted to allow union leaders to authorize a strike if negotiations failed. Salaried employees and temporary replacements will allow the company to continue meeting customers' needs for now.
