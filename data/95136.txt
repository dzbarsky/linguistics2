Cadence Takes on Mixed-Signal Design with Enhanced UltraSim Fast-SPICE Simulator.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that it is expanding into mixed-signal designs with its newly enhanced Cadence UltraSim Fast-SPICE simulator. Cadence chose memory design as its first target application because of its extreme speed and capacity requirements. UltraSim's new best-in-class post-layout capabilities including RC reduction and extraction-independent hierarchical stitching now make it an ideal choice for mixed-signal designs as well. Ricoh Corporation in Japan, IDT-Newave in China, and Faraday Technology Corporation in Taiwan are all now reaping the performance benefits of Cadence UltraSim. The UltraSim full-chip, transistor-level, Fast-SPICE technology is well known for providing extremely high speed while maintaining near-SPICE accuracy.
