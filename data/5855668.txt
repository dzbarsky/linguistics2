Starbucks Corp. Set to Move in as Another Store Readies to Close.
Starbucks Corp. announced that as one Starbucks in Cathedral City prepares to close, another is expected to open by Halloween. A new Starbucks is coming to the Plaza Rio Vista at the northwest corner of Landau Boulevard and Vista Chino. Officials with the coffee chain announced earlier this year that they're looking to close 600 shops, including the one at 68-718 E. Palm Canyon Drive in downtown Cathedral City. But city officials announced they don't know when that Starbucks will close. But there are still areas of desired growth for Starbucks.
