Illumina Inc. Announces Worldwide Availability of Multi-Sample, Genome-Wide Expression Microarrays.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has begun shipment of two Sentrix(R) BeadChips that, for the first time ever, enable whole-genome and RefSeq-based expression profiling of multiple samples on the same microarray. The new expression offerings, which have undergone extensive testing at customer locations, deliver high sensitivity, throughput and ease of use for gene discovery, pathway research and molecular characterization of disease. With pricing as low as $100 per sample, the new BeadChips are expected to dramatically reduce the cost of genome-wide expression analysis and allow researchers to expand the scale of biological experimentation. The Sentrix Human-6 BeadChip is designed to analyze six discrete human RNA samples on one chip, interrogating in each sample over 46,000 transcripts from the human genome. The Human-6 BeadChip contains over 10 million features.
