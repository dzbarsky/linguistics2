Molex Launches BradConnectivity Ultra-Lock 8-Pole Connection System.
Molex Inc. announced the Ultra-Lock(TM) 8-Pole Connection System featuring the convenience and security of an Ultra-Lock connection in a higher pin count to handle a broader array of applications such as encoders, resolvers, safety light curtains, trainable sensors and instrumentation. Designed for performance and reliability, the Ultra-Lock(TM) Connection System incorporates a thread-less push-to-lock connection that simplifies assembly and eliminates downtime related to intermittent signals due to loose connections. Its unique radial seal design ensures a consistent, operator independent seal every time. Fewer intermittent signals mean less downtime, more uptime and better productivity. The Ultra-Lock 8-pole uses innovative push-to-lock technology to make quick M12 connections by pushing down to connect and pulling up to disconnect.
