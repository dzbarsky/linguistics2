Illumina Introduces the Infinium HumanLinkage-12 Genotyping BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced the introduction of the Infinium HumanLinkage-12 Genotyping BeadChip, Illumina's fifth multi-sample Infinium BeadChip and the Company's first standard panel to take advantage of a twelve-sample format for linkage analysis. The HumanLinkage-12 BeadChip offers the lowest cost per sample for linkage analysis plus industry-leading call rates, uniform marker distribution, and superior SNP content. Powered by the Infinium Assay, this linkage panel is available for $90/sample, a competitive price with a PCR-free protocol and easy workflow. This new addition to the Linkage portfolio complements Illumina's GoldenGate?Human Linkage V Panel, which is particularly suitable for degraded samples such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE). The HumanLinkage-12 BeadChip is also available for researchers interested in conducting linkage analysis studies via Illumina's FastTrack Genotyping Service.
