Health Net Inc. to Pay $9 Million for Canceling Cancer Patient's Coverage.
Health Net Inc. will have to pay $9 million to a california woman whose insurance was cut off during the course of her treatment for breast cancer. Patsy Bates switched to Health Net from another insurer when she was convinced by an agent that it would save her money. When she lost her coverage, she was left with more than $129,000 in unpaid medical bills. The $9 million award consists of $8.4 million in punitive damages and $750,000 for emotional distress. Health Net is also defending a lawsuit filed by the Los Angeles City Attorney claiming that the insurer wrongfully canceled coverage for about 1,600 patients. That suit claims that Health Net had an incentive program for administrators who canceled policies. Health Net admitted that such a program existed in 2002 and 2003 but has since been terminated.
