Duke University Medical Center Selects Illumina Genome Analyzer to Sequence 50 Human Genomes.
Illumina Inc. announced that researchers at Duke University Medical Center will utilize Illumina's Genome Analyzer to study the resistance to HIV infection among 50 individuals that were highly exposed to the virus, but who remain uninfected. Duke University researchers will sequence the complete genome of at least 50 individuals with the desired phenotype. This study represents the first effort to search through the entire human genome for any variants, rare or common, that influence susceptibility to infection by HIV-1. Working with Illumina's next-generation sequencing technologies will allow us to rapidly and accurately screen the genomes of 50 individuals at very high coverage, amounting to the generation of as much data as was generated by the human genome project every two to three weeks. These studies will allow us to identify the most important genetic determinants of resistance to HIV-1 and may ultimately point the way toward new therapies to protect against HIV/AIDS'.
