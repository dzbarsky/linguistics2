Fluor Corporation Develops Master Plan for South Africa Solar Park.
Fluor Corporation announced that it was selected to perform a study for a potential solar park development in the Northern Cape for South Africa's Department of Energy. Following the recent completion of a pre-feasibility study by the Clinton Climate Initiative, a program of the William J. Clinton Foundation, Fluor will now develop a more detailed conceptual master plan to be unveiled at the upcoming South African Solar Park Investors Conference Oct. 28 and 29 in Upington Northern Cape Province of South Africa. The 5 gigawatt solar park is one of the largest proposed solar parks in the world. Upon completion of the conceptual study, a more detailed design plan will be developed. The South Africa Department of Energy intends to establish a Solar Park Authority as a unit within the state-owned Central Energy Fund to facilitate the advancement of the project.
