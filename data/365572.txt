Teradyne, Cadence And Xilinx Announce Industry's First Multi-Gigabit Backplane To FPGA Design Solution.
Teradyne Inc. Connection Systems Division, Cadence Design Systems Inc. and Xilinx Inc. announced the availability of an extended version of the Rocket I/O Design Kit for SPECCTRAQuest, the Cadence industry-leading signal integrity analysis tool. Designed for advanced hardware design, the RocketIO Design Kit enables users to simulate and validate multi-gigabit per second system-level interconnections, accurately modeling transceiver, PCB, and connector performance. Accurate modeling of multi-gigabit signaling is critical in the creation of the high-bandwidth connectivity demanded in networking, telecom, enterprise storage, and computer applications. The Xilinx RocketIO Design Kit for SPECCTRAQuest marks the first complete system solution spanning FPGAs, EDA software, and high-performance connectors.
