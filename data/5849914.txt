Federal Court Denied Lawsuit Against Principal Financial Group Inc..
A federal judge refused to certify as a class-action a lawsuit against Principal Financial Group Inc. that could have included as many as 57,000 401(k) plans. Judge have disagreed with the allegations in this lawsuit from the beginning, and the company aggressively argued against the class certification. Joseph Ruppert, on behalf of Fairmont Park Inc. Retirement Savings Plan, sued Principal Life Insurance Co. in December 2006. Ruppert, as trustee of the retirement plan of a Collinsville, Ill.-based racetrack, charged that Des Moines-based Principal failed to properly disclose revenue sharing to its plan participants. He also claimed Principal kept kickbacks from mutual funds in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
