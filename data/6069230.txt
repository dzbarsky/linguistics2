Cadence Design Systems Inc. Announces the Release of Open-Source SystemVerilog Solution.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced the release of an open-source SystemVerilog solution to help users include Synopsys' Verification Methodology Manual verification IP as users adopt the advanced environments supported by the Open Verification Methodology (OVM). This solution leverages investment in existing verification components in order to take advantage of the industry-leading features of the OVM and its vibrant ecosystem. These features include verification language interoperability, scaling from block to system, inter-component communication using transaction-level modeling, and advanced object-oriented capabilities for reuse and customization of these components. The Cadence solution, built on top of the OVM 2.0 release, lets users run both OVM and VMM VIP within a single OVM environment. The OVM environment configures the VMM VIP, which communicates using both OVM sequences and virtual sequences, and uses the OVM message utility.
