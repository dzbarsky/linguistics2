Atheros Communications Inc. launched the AR8216 -- the company's first Ethernet switch product and the industry's lowest-cost, 6-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet switch. The AR8216 supports a wide array of wired and wireless networking applications and also targets mainstream 802.11n and 802.11g wireless router and gateway platforms. With the launch of its own high-performance, low-cost Fast Ethernet switch solution, Atheros now provides networking customers with all of the major silicon required for complete wire-to-wireless router solutions. These single-source, end-to-end networking designs feature Atheros' market-leading wireless LAN (WLAN), the industry's only network processors designed expressly for Wi-Fi and the company's new Fast Ethernet switch.
