Fidelity National Information Services Inc. announced that VTB24 has gone live with the FIS Profile(R) core banking suite. Over the next two to three years, VTB24 plans to not just increase its customer base significantly but also to develop strong long-term partner relationships with each individual client.

This will be followed by current account, deposit and credit line products, debit and credit cards.
