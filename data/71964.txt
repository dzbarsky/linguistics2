San Diego Firm Is Sued by Partner in DNA Project.
Illumina Inc. is being sued by its powerhouse partner on the project, Applied Biosystems Group. A patent infringement lawsuit that Applied Biosystems filed alleges that Illumina breached the companies' 1999 joint venture to develop the instrument and bring it to market. The lawsuit became public when Illumina retaliated by sending an official notification alleging that it was Foster City based Applied Biosystems that broke the pact. The legal wrangling raises questions about the future of Illumina's proposed system for analyzing tiny variations in human DNA called snips or single nucleotide polymorphisms. The Applied Biosystems lawsuit, filed in Northern California federal district court, is designed to block Illumina from selling that system. The lawsuit alleges that Illumina is infringing on patents related to technology used in connecting pieces of DNA together.
