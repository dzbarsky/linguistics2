The New York Times Company Reports Revenues Results for the Month of February 2011; Provides Revenues Guidance for the First Quarter of 2011.
"The New York Times Company said that it ended the month of February 2011 with print advertising revenues down in the low-single digits. However the company said the improvement in print advertising trends that the company saw in late January 2011 continued into February. Also, similar to January 2011, digital advertising revenues in February 2011 were up in the mid-single digits, as solid growth at the News Media Group was partially offset by softness at the About Group. The company said that it continues to expect circulation revenues in the first quarter of 2011 to decrease in line with the declines it had experienced in the second half of 2010."
