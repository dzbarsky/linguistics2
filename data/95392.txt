Menorah Gardens faces criminal charges, fines over moving bodies.
The state filed criminal felony charges against the world's largest funeral industry company charging it with unearthing old bodies and tossing aside their bones to make room for more burials. In the state's civil case against the company, Service Corporation International of Houston will have to pay up to $14 million in fines and restitution as part of a settlement agreement also announced Thursday by Florida's attorney general. SCI and Vice President Jeffrey Frucht were charged with incompetence and misconduct in operating a cemetery. Former superintendent Robert McKay was charged twice with failing to get written permission before disinterring a body. Investigators found some of the remains of two men, Hyman Cohen and Harold Wells, near a wooded area.
