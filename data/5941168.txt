Illumina Inc. Launches GenomeStudio(TM) Data Analysis Software.
Illumina Inc. introduced GenomeStudio Software, a primary analysis software program designed to analyze both microarray and sequencing data. For researchers, GenomeStudio Software enables the correlation of biological variation across multiple applications and graphical display of the results. The flexibility of GenomeStudio Software also allows researchers to integrate with third-party software providers for advanced downstream analysis. GenomeStudio Software will be broadly available to researchers in November 2008. Under an early access program, Illumina offered GenomeStudio Software to customers from both academic research institutes and genome centers around the world. Among them was Stephen Kingsmore's lab at the National Center for Genetic Research (NCGR), Richard Michelmore's lab at University of California, Davis, Andy Fire's Lab at Stanford University, Barbara Wold's lab at the California Institute of Technology, and James Hadfield's lab at Cancer Research UK-Cambridge Research Institute.
