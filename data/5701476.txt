Harsco Corp. Receives $60 Million Contract for On-site Environmental Services to Steel Plant.
Harsco Corp. announced that its worldwide mill services division has been awarded a new ten-year contract valued at more than $60 million over its duration to provide on-site environmental services to ArcelorMittal's massive Dunkirk steel works in northern France. The contract underscores Harsco's growing role in developing and executing integrated environmental solutions for the global metals and minerals industries. The award includes the construction of a new dehydrating plant that will process the mill's blast furnace and melt shop sludge by-products into reusable filter cake material suitable for use within the steelmaking process as well as other external applications. The award also includes the screening and blending of various by-product materials for on-site recycling to the mill's sinter plant, which produces materials for charging the mill's three blast furnaces. Work is scheduled to commence at the beginning of 2009.
