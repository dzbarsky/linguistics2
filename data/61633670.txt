UMC Adopts Cadence Design Systems Inc.'s 40-Nanometer Reference Flow for Low Power, Verification, Implementation and DFM-Aware Design.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that it has delivered an end-to-end CPF-based low power and DFM-aware design, verification, and implementation solution tuned for semiconductor foundry UMC in support of its 40-nanometer process technology. The new reference flow provides designers with a reliable, UMC-validated methodology incorporating the latest in low power techniques and model-based DFM analysis and optimization capabilities for maximum power efficiency, superior quality of results, and accelerated yield ramp for advanced node designs. The Cadence methodology for UMC's 40-nanometer process allows designers to create power-efficient chips using a single methodology that delivers consistent power intent all the way to production. In addition, the flow supports the UMC 40-nanometer process with advanced design-side DFM capabilities during physical implementation for lower risk and faster time to volume. The UMC reference flow employs the CPF-enabled Encounter(R) Digital Implementation (EDI) System and C
