Cadence Helps Sequans Achieve Early Time to Market with Wireless Broadband Chip Tapeout.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that its Engineering Services team helped Sequans Communications to meet a challenging time-to-market goal for a high-performance system on chip (SoC). Sequans Communications utilized tools, design expertise and intellectual property from Cadence(R) to mitigate design risks and ensure high quality of silicon (QoS), a new metric for synthesis results that includes performance, area and power measured with wires. The chip was designed to comply with the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard and WiMAX system profiles for broadband wireless access. Sequans Communications benefited from the comprehensive digital IC design flow based on the Cadence Encounter(TM) digital IC design platform. As part of the engagement, Cadence also supplied analog IP designed using the Virtuoso(R) custom design platform.
