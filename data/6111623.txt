Brocade Communications Systems Inc. has announced the appointment of Marc Randall as senior vice president of products and offerings, and Dave Stevens as chief technology officer.

Prior to his new role, Randall was chief executive at Force10 Networks, vice president of engineering at Cisco Systems, and served 13 years at Amdahl. Stevens was most recently founder and chief executive at Palo Alto Networks. He was previously vice president at Brocade and CTO of Brocade Transport Systems.
