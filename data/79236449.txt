Fluor Mulls Acquisitions.
Fluor Corporation plans to look for acquisitions. Alan Boeckmann, Chief Executive of the firm said that spending has shifted towards the exploration and production side, both offshore and onshore, and that this area is one of its target areas for potential acquisitions, along with infrastructure businesses. He added, The clients' capital programs have definitely shifted away from the downstream, where it had been over the last couple of years. And so ... the prospects out there reflect that.
