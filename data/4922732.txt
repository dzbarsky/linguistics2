Atheros Communications Inc. Announces Atheros ROCm(TM) Single-chip AR6002 Family.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the Atheros ROCm(TM) single-chip AR6002 family which features breakthrough low-power for mobile WLAN solutions. The game-changing power efficiency delivered by the AR6002 draws near-zero standby power and has nominal impact on battery life even in active mode, both key considerations in the design of Wi-Fi-enabled mobile products. With its exceptionally low-power designs for mobile and Atheros' leading performance in Wi-Fi throughput and connection reliability, the company intends to catalyze the adoption of Wi-Fi in the handheld and mobile device markets. The Atheros AR6002 consumes 70% less power than competitive solutions on the market in active mode while downloading content. This substantial power reduction results in longer battery life, enabling significantly more downloads and longer talk time between mobile device charges. For example, the AR6002 solution will take more than 100 hours to deplete a standard 3.7V, 800mAh phone battery in continual VoIP mode. In ano
