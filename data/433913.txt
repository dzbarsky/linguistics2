Illumina Inc. Announces Six Human Genomes on a Single Beadchip.
Illumina Inc. (ILMN) announced its entry into the whole-genome gene expression market with the launch of two new Sentrix BeadChips. Illumina's new six-sample whole-genome BeadChip will compete with recently announced microarray products analyzing one genome on a chip. The first BeadChip is designed to analyze six discrete whole-human-genome samples on one chip, interrogating in each sample approximately 48,000 transcripts from the estimated 30,000 genes in the human genome. The second BeadChip product analyzes 8 samples in parallel against the roughly 22,000 genes represented in the consensus RefSeq database, a well-characterized whole-genome subset used broadly in genetic analysis. The new BeadChips will dramatically reduce the cost of whole-genome expression analysis, allowing researchers to expand the scale and reproducibility of large-scale biological experimentation. The new Sentrix BeadChips leverage the extremely dense geometries pioneered in the Sentrix Array Matrix.
