AK Steel Holding Corp. Plans to Layoff Salaried Workforce.
AK Steel Holding Corp. announced that it is implementing a salaried workforce layoff plan due to the continuing economic downturn, which has significantly impacted AK Steel's customers, resulting in fewer orders for the company's steel products. AK Steel currently employs about 1,500 salaried employees. The layoffs will likely affect salaried employees in all of the company's plants and offices. While the company announced that it hopes the layoffs are temporary, a continuation of the economic downturn could result in some or all of the layoffs becoming permanent job reductions.
