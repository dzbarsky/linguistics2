Cadence Design Systems Inc. Achieves First-Silicon Results on 32nm Common Platform(TM) Technology.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced first-silicon results on 32-nanometer (nm) Common Platform high-k metal-gate (HKMG) technology, manufactured at IBM. Cadence(R) and the Common Platform alliance, comprised of IBM, Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung Electronics, collaborated to tackle systematic and random variability in advanced node designs. The silicon results represent a significant milestone for designers with stringent design-for-manufacturing (DFM) requirements, and can enable Encounter(R) Digital Implementation (EDI) System to provide significant power savings, yield enhancement and time-to-market advantages. The 32nm silicon results provide a rich and expansive data set modeling the HKMG process in relation to layout rules, design rule checking and device interconnect models. In addition, they capture critical information related to device and interconnect variability, including systematic, random, within-die and die-to-die variation, as well as manufacturing effects including litho
