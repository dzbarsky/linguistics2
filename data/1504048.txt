Illumina Announces Plan to Release One-Million-SNP Genotyping BeadChips by June 2006.
Illumina Inc. announced that it plans to release by June 2006 a whole-genome microarray offering that will utilize the Company's new Infinium(TM) assay and enable researchers to genotype one million SNPs on a pair of Sentrix(R) BeadChips. Single BeadChip offerings containing 250,000 and 500,000 fixed-content SNP markers will be developed and released on the path to the million-SNP product. Development of the high-density genotyping product line will take advantage of three important factors: - Illumina's proprietary Infinium assay, a PCR-less, fully automatable, single-tube genotyping assay that is infinitely scaleable and enables unconstrained locus selection for maximal genome coverage, data quality and information content, - Near-term availability of validated HapMap, cSNP and nsSNP content and increased understanding of the relative scientific value of SNP markers, allowing design of information-rich products and - Manufacturing infrastructure that Illumina has put in place for the upcoming launch of its
