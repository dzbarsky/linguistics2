Brocade validated its common 4Gb/8Gb Fibre Channel driver stack and 8Gb technology ASIC in the Brocade 415/425/815/825 HBAs through the VMware I/O Vendor Program (IOVP), which allows for releasing device drivers independently of VMware's own product releases. The Brocade 415/815 (single port) and 425/825 (dual port) Fibre Channel HBAs provide end-to-end sever-to-storage data center networking at high performance levels.
