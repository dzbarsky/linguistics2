Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against AK Steel Holding Corp..
A federal appeals court upheld a ruling awarding at least $46.2 million to 1,250 former employees of AK Steel Holding Corp. who claimed the steelmaker miscalculated their pension benefits under an early retirement program. The plaintiffs, who had retired or were terminated since Jan. 1, 1995, sued the company in 2002. They said that AK's method of calculating payments did not comply with federal law and resulted in underpayments for participants in one of its pension plans. A U.S. District Court judge issued a partial ruling in favor of the employees in April 2004, and in February 2006 awarded them $37.6 million in damages and $8.6 million in interest, which continues to accrue.
