AK Steel Holding Corp. plans to lay off more employees from its stainless operations. The company confirmed that 34 employees at the mill were to be furloughed November 17, 2008. This is the latest in a series of cutbacks for AK STeel, which recently announced the idling of its Mansfield, Ohio, operations and most of its Ashland, Ky., operations as it copes with the effects of the global economic slowdown. At least 600 hourly workers will be laid off at the Ashland plant beginning November 22, 2008.
