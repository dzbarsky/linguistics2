Fluor Corporation and E.ON Energie AG Join Forces for Coal-fired Power Plants.
Fluor Corporation and E.ON Energie AG announced that the two companies have formed strategic partnership for the development of a retrofitted pilot plant using Fluor's commercially-proven Econamine FG+ carbon capture technology. The pilot plant will commence operation in 2010 at E.ON's coal-fired power plant in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. The primary focus of this partnership is to enhance the technology and to demonstrate its application to safely separate carbon from the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant. This will be the first demonstration of the technology on a coal-fired power plant. Both companies, in applying the Econamine FG+ process, will demonstrate an optimized adaptation of the CO2 scrubbing process that complies with U.S. and EU environmental requirements. E.ON brings essential experience in the operation and engineering of coal-fired power plants to this strategic partnership.
