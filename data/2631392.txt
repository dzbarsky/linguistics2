Atheros Teams with Qualcomm for Cellular/Wi-Fi Solution.
Atheros Communications and Qualcomm this week are demonstrating interoperability between their chipsets as they pursue an integrated cellular/Wi-Fi solution that can be used on most 3G networks, including WCDMA and CDMA EV/DO. For enterprises, the ability to let employees use voice over IP (VoIP) via the enterprise Wi-Fi network offers potential cost savings and a improved in-building coverage for a mobile phone user. Such handsets have been available in the GSM market for some time, but their availability to date in the CDMA market has been limited to expensive smart phones. The key point is that people have to buy smart phones that cost $400-$500 to get that [Wi-Fi] functionality, he said. What Qualcomm is doing is bringing Wi-Fi functionality to the feature phone, and feature phones are obviously lower cost.
