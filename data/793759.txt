Invitrogen Corporation and Illumina Inc. Announces a Strategic Collaboration to Leverage Their Respective Strengths.
Invitrogen Corp. and Illumina Inc. announced a strategic collaboration to leverage their respective strengths in nucleic acid synthesis and distribution to deliver oligonucleotides of unequaled value to the life sciences market worldwide. The collaboration will expand Illumina's Oligator DNA synthesis technology and combine that capability with Invitrogen's extensive sales, marketing and distribution channels. Oligonucleotides (oligos) are small, synthetic pieces of DNA that are an essential component of all genetic research, and global researchers will benefit from access to oligos with industry-leading quality and value available in both tube and plate formats, as well as reliable order turnaround times. Under the terms of the agreement, Invitrogen will invest $3.4 million in Illumina's San Diego facility to enable implementation of fourth-generation Oligator technology, extend the technology into tube-based oligo products and provide for transfer of the technology into two additional Invitrogen facilities
