Harsco Corporation Adds to Outsourced Services at French Steel Mill with $18 Million Contract.
Harsco Corporation announced a new Harsco Metals outsourced mill services contract in France with Arcelor Mittal valued at approximately $18 million over its duration, as steel production levels continue to gradually recover in key markets served by Harsco. The new five-year contract builds on Harsco's 40-year history of providing onsite mill services at the ArcelorMittal Dunkerque works in northern France, an integrated steel mill producing over 6 million tons of steel per annum for the automotive industry and other customers. Harsco will expand its onsite role to provide refractory maintenance and meltshop services in continuous support of the mill's ladle metallurgy furnace and converter operations.
