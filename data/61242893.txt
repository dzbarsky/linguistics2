Gentex Corp. Supplies Auto-Dimming Mirrors with its Automatic High-Beam Assist (SmartBeam) Feature for the 2010 Range Rover Sport and Discovery 4 Sport Utility Vehicles.
Gentex Corp. announced that it is supplying auto-dimming mirrors with its Automatic High-Beam Assist (SmartBeam) feature for the 2010 Range Rover Sport and Discovery 4 sport utility vehicles. The 2010 models will be available worldwide beginning in late summer 2009. In addition to offering interior auto-dimming mirrors, both the Sport and the new Discovery 4 models feature Gentex's SmartBeam High-Beam Headlamp Assist as an option. SmartBeam uses a miniature camera-on-a-chip combined with algorithmic decision making to automatically turn a vehicle's high beams on and off according to surrounding traffic conditions. The system is designed to maximize a vehicle's forward lighting and to eliminate the repetitive and sometimes burdensome task of turning the high beams on and off.
