New Cadence Incisive Verification Platform Compresses Overall Verification of Nanometer-Scale Designs by up to 50 Percent.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced the Cadence(R) Incisive(TM) verification platform, the first single-kernel verification platform for nanometer-scale designs that supports a unified verification methodology for the embedded software, control, data path, and analog/mixed-signal/RF design domains. The new platform's unified methodology helps slash testbench development time, verification runtime and debug time, and can compress overall verification time by up to 50 percent. This enables a dramatic improvement in time-to-market for semiconductor customers, and accelerated system design-in of complex ICs for design chain partners.
