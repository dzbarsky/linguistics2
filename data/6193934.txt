KeyCorp Announces Construction of Two New Branches in Westlake and Macedonia.
KeyCorp announced that it has finished construction of two new branches in Westlake and Macedonia. The Macedonia branch, at 640 E. Aurora Road, is Key's first branch in that community. The Westlake location, at 1411 Columbia Road, replaces a branch that was nearby. The new branches come on the heels of openings in the last two months on East 185th Street in Cleveland, on North Court Street in Medina and on Tuscarawas Street in Canton. In February, Key will open a new branch on Center Street in Chardon. The Cleveland bank is also renovating several other branches.
