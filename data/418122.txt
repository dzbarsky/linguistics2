Service Corp. International's Shareholders filed a lawsuit against the Company.
Attorney Kenneth Vianale, on behalf of share holders of Service Corp. International, filed the lawsuit in Miami federal court against Houston-based Service Corp. International and three executives accusing them of violating federal securities laws. Vianale said shareholders affected by double-digit percentage drops in the company's stock price were defrauded because company officials made no disclosure of the problems at Menorah Gardens which were substantial. The lawsuit filed Jan. 15, seeks class-action status. It doesn't specify damages. The company also settled a state lawsuit by paying $14 million in fines and restitution and promising that burial problems won't happen again.
