Service Corp. International Serves Lockout Notice at Two Cemeteries in Burnaby, One in Kelowna.
Service Corp. International served lock-out notice to its employees. About 64 inside and outside workers -- members of the Construction and Specialized Worker Union, are maintaining passive pickets at the facilities. So far only one interment has been rescheduled as a result of the labour disruption but only a handful of memorial services had been scheduled for the normally busy weekend period. The bargaining impasse came after workers rejected the company's latest contract offer by a vote of 50 to zero.
