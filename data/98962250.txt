AES Corporation Mulls Acquisitions.
The AES Corporation held its earnings conference call. The company intends to look at acquisition opportunities. Victoria Harker, EVP and CFO of the company said: What we're trying to do is to give a view into the short-term uses as we look out into where we might invest, and/or through acquisitions. But in the short term, when we look at 2010, the impact will be $0.07 to $0.09. The low end of that dilution range, the $0.07, would assume obviously either the $1.58 billion debt pay-down, or a midyear investment, so July/August, of $500 million in a mid-teens type return project. He added: But then we would also take the remaining $1 billion and split it between cash and debt pay-down. On the upper end we would assume we would only pay down about $500 million and retain the remainder of cash, assuming we needed it for investments and/or strategic acquisitions in the short term. So that kind of [balances] (technical difficulty) the types of things in the 2010 time frame we would do with the cash.
