Harsco Corp. Revises Earnings Guidance for the Full Year 2009; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Third Quarter of 2009.
"Harsco Corp. revised earnings guidance for the full year 2009. The company is adjusting its full-year 2009 guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations to a new range of 172 to 182 from the previous range of 192 to 210. The company provided earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2009. The third quarter will be negatively impacted by the deterioration of the construction market as it mentioned, thus the third quarter is expected to be below the second quarter performance and by the way, if look historically, the second quarter has always been its strongest quarter and so this is not a major surprise, and will also be below last year's third quarter for the obvious reasons. For the third quarter, the company is forecasting earnings from continuing operations in the range of $0.45 to $0.50 per share, compared with $0.99 in last year's record third quarter."
