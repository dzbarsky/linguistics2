Atheros Communications Launches Market-Leading Wireless Network Processor for Ultimate 802.11n Networking.
Atheros Communications Inc. announced the newest member of its AR7100 Wireless Network Processing Unit (WNPU) family -- the AR7161. The highly optimized and cost-effective WNPU unlocks the full potential of 802.11n technology to enable simultaneous high-bandwidth applications, like high-definition (HD) video streaming, network attached storage and multiplayer gaming, in addition to wireless printing, audio streaming and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony. The AR7161 was specifically designed to support the highest 802.11n performance in a cost-effective processor solution. The full benefits of the WNPU are realized in Atheros' newly launched 802.11n-chipset, the AR5008AP-3NX2, which is based on XSPAN(TM) with Signal-Sustain Technology(TM). The chipset enables a dual-concurrent, 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) plus 5 GHz wireless LAN (WLAN) access point (AP)/router solution featuring a 3x3 MIMO design (three complete RF transmit and receive chains).
