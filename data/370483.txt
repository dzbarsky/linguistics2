Molex Inc. announces ParaLink-P, the next offering in its ParaLink Parallel Optical Interconnect product line. The ParaLink-P is a pluggable 12-channel parallel module for high-speed, high-density optical data transfer applications such as optical cross connect switches and terabit routers. These modules plug into a 10 x 10 BGA socket previously mounted on the motherboard allowing for more flexible final assembly, test, and repair processes. Molex ParaLink-P devices come in separate 12-channel transmitter and receiver modules. The transmitter is based on a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) array with monitor feedback providing constant optical output over the transmitter's lifetime.
