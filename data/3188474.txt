Illumina Introduces World's First Multi-Sample Whole-Genome Genotyping Beadchips.
Illumina Inc. introduced two new products in its Infinium Whole-Genome Genotyping product line, the HumanHap300-Duo and the HumanHap300-Duo+ Genotyping Bead Chips. These products are the worlds first multi-sample whole-genome genotyping arrays, enabling researchers to analyze two samples simultaneously, with over 634,000 total tag SNPs on a single Bead Chip, 317,000 tag SNPs per sample. Consistent with the HumanHap300, the new products deliver a level of genomic coverage that would require more than twice the number of randomly selected SNPs. The HumanHap300-Duo+ allows for the addition of 60,000 custom SNP loci to the base product, enabling researchers to enrich for SNPs of interest in any genomic region. This flexibility allows for genetic variation to be studied more specifically within the context of a given study design or disease interest, while taking advantage of the cost and workflow efficiencies of the dual-sample format. The unique, multi-sample format of the HumanHap300-Duo products makes them an
