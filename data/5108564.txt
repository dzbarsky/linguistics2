Center Parcs Deals with Select Service Partners and Starbucks.
Center Parcs has signed agreements with Select Service Partners (SSP) and Starbucks, which will see the two companies operate outlets across its four holiday villages. Under the terms of the agreement, Starbucks will open 10 units, comprising eight outlets and two kiosks, which will be operated under a franchising agreement by Center Parcs. The deal will also see SSP operate two gastropubs at the Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, and Elveden Forest, Suffolk. The new units will replace the existing Hugo's restaurants at the two sites. The agreements are part of a planned ?6.3 million spend by Center Parcs over the next 12 months, across its food & beverage and retail units. The new investment is part of the company's wider ?17 million investment programme in its restaurants and retail units, and follows its recent ?60 million spend on upgrading and expanding its accommodation.
