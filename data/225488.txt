AES Corporation Stock Purchasers Represented by Schatz & Nobel in Class Action Lawsuit.
"A lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of The AES Corp. The Complaint alleges that AES, a global energy and utility company, and certain of its officers and directors issued materially misleading statements concerning AES's business condition. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose that the United Kingdom had adopted a new framework for the pricing of energy that undermined AES's ability to achieve profitability in its United Kingdom activities, and that the Company lacked adequate long-term contracts to avoid a rapid decline in its United Kingdom operations."
