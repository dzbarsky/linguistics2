Illumina Inc. Announces Creation of the Illumina Genome Network.
Illumina Inc. announced the creation of the Illumina Genome Network, a global partnership designed to link researchers interested in conducting large-scale whole human genome sequencing projects with leading institutions that can perform such projects using Illumina sequencing. The Genome Network will provide researchers who do not have access to high-quality, next-generation sequencing technology an economical and dependable way to complete their sequencing projects. The Illumina Genome Network will include leading academic and commercial institutions worldwide that can rapidly process large-scale sequencing projects. Participating institutions must also have completed Illumina's Certified Service Provider (CSPro) certification. Illumina will serve as the channel to connect interested researchers with Network partners that will then perform the sequencing. The Network will focus on offering only whole genome human sequencing services for large scale projects. GMI/Macrogen Inc. and the National Center for Gen
