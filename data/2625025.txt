Illumina Awarded Genotyping Contract by SAIC-Frederick Inc. for Cancer Genetics Marker Susceptibility (CGEMS) Study.
Illumina Inc. announced that it is has been awarded a genotyping services contract by SAIC-Frederick Inc. under prime contract to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to perform whole-genome SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) scans on over 2,500 prostrate case and control samples provided by the Institute. The genotyping supports the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS), an NCI Strategic Initiative coordinated through the NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), the NCI Core Genotyping Facility (CGF) and the NCI Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG). The CGEMS initiative is designed to map susceptibility in prostrate and breast cancers, with the aim of understanding disease cause and progression, and then identifying strategies for prevention, earlier detection and treatment. Illumina will use its Sentrix(R) HumanHap300 BeadChip and Infinium(TM) assay to perform the genotyping. Each HumanHap300 BeadChip can query over 317,000 SNP markers composed principally of tagSNPs identified and
