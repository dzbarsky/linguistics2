Cadence Design Systems Inc. Unveils Next-Generation Parallel Circuit Simulator for the Verification of Complex Analog and Mixed-Signal IC Designs.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced the availability of Cadence(R) Virtuoso(R) Accelerated Parallel Simulator (APS), its next-generation circuit simulator, with the full accuracy of the industry reference Virtuoso Spectre(R) Circuit Simulator, developed to solve the largest and most complex analog and mixed-signal designs across all process nodes. A key part of the Cadence Multi-Mode Simulation solution (MMSIM) 7.1 release, the new simulator consists of a combination of proven Cadence simulation technologies and a breakthrough parallel circuit solver, along with a newly architected engine that efficiently harnesses the power of multiprocessing computing platforms. The result is a circuit simulator with an accuracy and use model identical to the Virtuoso Spectre Circuit Simulator, delivering significantly improved single-thread performance and scalable multi-thread performance. The Virtuoso Accelerated Parallel Simulator improves convergence and capacity for designs with hundreds of thousands of transistors,
