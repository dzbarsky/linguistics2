Faraday Technology Corporation Chooses Cadence Low-Power Solution.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that Faraday Technology Corporation has utilized the Common Power Format (CPF) enabled Cadence(R) Low-Power Solution to successfully tape out more than 20 low-power chip designs. As a ASIC services company, Faraday has seen customers' designs increasing in complexity. This has resulted in a 3X average increase of design sizes over the past year. However, by using an integrated methodology based on the CPF-enabled Cadence Low-Power Solution, as well as adopting a platform-based design approach, Faraday was able to take on the increased design complexity and improve average design time by 20% over the course of the year. This trend was demonstrated consistently over a span of more than 20 low-power designs. The Cadence Low-Power Solution features critical technologies for power-efficient design, including the Encounter(R) Digital Implementation System and Conformal Low-Power. By using the Encounter Digital Implementation System for physical implementation, Faraday's design
