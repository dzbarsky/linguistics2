Cadence Enables Motorola With Leading Analog/Mixed-Signal Design Solution.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. has added Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector (SPS) to a series of major customer wins for its Assura product family. Motorola's SPS has adopted Assura(TM) RCX, the Cadence full-chip 3D device-level parasitic extraction solution, for its analog and full-custom design flows. Motorola's internal mixed-signal design kit is designed to support the processes in the Assura physical verification solution for LVS, DRC and RCX. Motorola selected Assura RCX because it provides consistently high accuracy for device-level parasitic resistance and capacitance extraction. Assura RCX also provides the best-in-class integration to the Cadence Analog Design Environment. Assura is a tightly integrated part of the Cadence Analog Design Environment, the industry's de facto standard for analog and full-custom designs, leading to the highest productivity solution available. In addition, Cadence Analog Design Environment users, such as Motorola, experience quick, reliable migration from Diva to Assu
