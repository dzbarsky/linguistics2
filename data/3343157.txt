Schatz Nobel Izard, P.C. Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Hansen Natural Corp.
Schatz Nobel Izard, P.C. announced that it has filed a lawsuit seeking class action status in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of Hansen Natural Corp. between November 12, 2001 and November 9, 2006, inclusive. The complaint alleges that the company and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws by issuing positive press releases, statements and financial reports which were materially false and misleading because they failed to disclose the following adverse facts-that the company engaged in the backdating of stock option grants for certain key executives; that the company lacked adequate internal controls and was therefore unable to ascertain its true financial condition and that as a result of the foregoing, it engaged in improper accounting practices.
