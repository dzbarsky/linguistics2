Starbucks Corp. Provides Earnings Guidance for the Second Quarter and Full Year of Fiscal 2008.
"Starbucks Corp. reported preliminary results for second quarter ended March 30, 2008. For the quarter, the company now expects revenue to increase 12% and earnings per share to be $0.15, compared with $0.19 per share for the same period a year ago. Starbucks estimates that costs associated with the implementation of its transformation agenda, and charges related to the rationalization of its store portfolio, negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share in its fiscal 2008 second quarter. Given Starbucks year-to-date results and an expectation of continued weakness in the U.S. consumer climate, the company now expects full-year fiscal 2008 EPS to be somewhat lower than the $0.87 reported in fiscal 2007."
