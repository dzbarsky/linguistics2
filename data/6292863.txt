Starbucks Corp. Delays Opening of Farmer Support Center in Ethiopia.
Starbucks Corp. announced that it is not sure when it will open a center in Ethiopia to support coffee farmers due to the downturn in the global economy and delays in opening a similar center in Rwanda. The company announced that it had originally hoped its Ethiopian Farmer Support Center would be open by now, but delays in opening the Rwanda center and the global slowdown in the economy have made it challenging for it to move. The company will use both centers to work with coffee farmers to improve coffee quality and help them produce more coffee that can be purchased by specialty coffee buyers.
