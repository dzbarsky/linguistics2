Phillips-Van Has Fire Power To Make Acquisitions Of Up To $1 Billion.
Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. said that the company has the required fire power to consider acquisitions in the range of $500 million and $1 billion. Manny Chirico, Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, Chairman and CEO, said: We are being very aggressive on the acquisition front. We continue to look for brands that we can layer on to our platform. We continue to generate significant amount of cash in all of our operations. Last year we ended the year with over $250 million in cash on our books. We will generate close to $100 million this year. Given $350 million in cash, our borrowing base that is in excess of $400 million, we could very easily do acquisition between $500 million and $1 billion by just writing a check.
