Illumina Introduces Three New Research Products to Study Genetic Variations Linked to Cancer Development.
Illumina Inc. announced that it is making available three new product solutions for cancer research, which include expansion of Illumina's proprietary DASL(R) Assay to whole-genome profiling, and the launch of DASL focused expression and methylation profiling on Illumina's VeraCode(R) technology. These new solutions allow researchers to leverage synergies across Illumina technology platforms to better understand the complex molecular mechanisms that give rise to cancer. Illumina's DASL Assay was specifically designed to successfully profile expression in degraded RNA, such as that found in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. At the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute researchers are using whole-genome DASL profiling to identify molecular profiles associated with chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer. Finally, using Illumina's GoldenGate(R) Assay for Methylation with the VeraCode technology, researchers can now uncover epigenetic modifications in DNA that have significant and widespread effects on ge
