Avery Dennison Corporation Settles Case That Accuses of Promising or Making Improper Payments to Foreign Officials.
Avery Dennison Corporation has settled a case that accused the company of promising or making improper payments to foreign officials. A litigation statement issued by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission announced the Pasadena-based company has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $200,000. Avery has neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. According to the SEC news release, Avery China's Reflectives Division paid or authorized the payments of several kickbacks, sightseeing trips and gifts to Chinese government officials. The illegal payments-which amounted to about $30,000-and the promises were made with the purpose and effect of improperly influencing decisions by foreign officials to assist Avery China to obtain or retain business.
