Industrial Technology Research Institute Adopts Cadence Design Systems Inc.'s C-to-Silicon Compiler to Boost Designer Productivity.
Cadence Design Systems Inc. announced that Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a non-profit organization that serves to strengthen the technological competitiveness of Taiwan, has adopted Cadence(R) C-to-Silicon Compiler for its RTL design. As a result, Cadence C-to-Silicon Compiler is significantly increasing ITRI's design capabilities and shortening development time for its PAC Duo project while increasing engineering productivity. Cadence C-to-Silicon Compiler is next-generation high-level synthesis for transaction-level model (TLM)-driven design and verification. By adopting Cadence C-to-Silicon Compiler, ITRI significantly increased design productivity and eased legacy design reuse by starting design above the RTL-level of abstraction, using SystemC TLM. ITRI's first project using C-to-Silicon Compiler showed approximately 12% and 10% improvements respectively in power consumption and area relative to hand-coded RTL, at the same clock-speed. These results were achieved with 70% less engineer
