Illumina Inc. Introduces High-Throughput Solutions with Walkaway Automation.
Illumina Inc. announced that it has introduced the Illumina AutoLoader to stage up to 40 high-density Sentrix(R) BeadChips for scanning on a BeadStation - sufficient for 15 hours of unattended, automated operation. Combined with a new software release for BeadStation that increases scan speed, system operators can now achieve scanning throughput 400% greater than previously possible. In addition to the new Illumina AutoLoader and upgraded software, Illumina systems provide for extensive robotics for sample preparation and labeling, revolutionary assay technologies for whole-genome genotyping, software for automated genotype calling, and a laboratory information management system (LIMS) that annotates, validates and data captures every single step performed on each sample through the entire process. These new offerings are available immediately and support all current and future Sentrix BeadChip configurations. Throughput calculations are based on Illumina's latest offering, the HumanHap550 BeadChip, which con
