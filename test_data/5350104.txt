Illumina Launches the iScan(TM) System.
Illumina Inc. launched the iScan System, a next-generation scanner that provides researchers conducting genotyping and gene expression studies with significantly greater throughput, enhanced automation, and improved ease of use. When used with the recently launched Infinium(R) High-Density (HD) Human1M-Duo and Human610-Quad Genotyping BeadChips, and Illumina's laboratory information management systems and automation options, the iScan System can complete genotyping studies up to six times faster than studies run on Illumina's BeadStation. Under an Early Access Program, Illumina began shipping the iScan System in the first quarter of 2008 to customers in both the academic and industrial sector. Among them were Scripps Genomics Medicine and Translational Science Institute and Cogenics. Cogenics is a division of Clinical Data and plans to use the iScan System to bolster their services offerings. Illumina will commence broad commercial shipment of the iScan System in the second quarter of 2008.
