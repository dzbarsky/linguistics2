Starbucks Corp. Settles with the National Labor Relations Board.
Starbucks Corp. has agreed to a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board on charges of anti-union activities at its Mall of America store that stemmed from the July firing of a barista who tried to organize workers. The settlement agreement reached with the NLRB concerning alleged efforts to stop workers from joining a union. It comes in the wake of the August reinstatement of barista Erik Forman, who still is trying to organize Starbucks workers at Twin Cities stores into a union called the Starbucks Workers Union.
