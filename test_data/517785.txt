Illumina Announces 100,000 SNPs on a Single BeadChip.
Illumina Inc. announced the first in a line of fixed-content genotyping products based on a revolutionary new assay and Sentrix(R) BeadChip configuration. This line of microarrays will allow large-scale interrogation of variation in the human genome at many levels of resolution, accelerating the ability of researchers to cost-effectively unlock the genetic basis of disease. The first product will target at least 100,000 SNPs located in high-value genetic regions of human genome. Illumina's new assay protocol features single-tube sample preparation and does not require PCR or ligation steps, significantly reducing labor and potential sample-handling errors. The ability to analyze hundreds of thousands of high-value SNPs at a low cost per data point will equip researchers with an important set of tools for studying the genetic association between affected and control populations. The assay's enzymatic discrimination provides high call rates and accuracy with unconstrained locus selection.
