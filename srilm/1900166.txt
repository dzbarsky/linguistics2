AK Steel Recycling Waste Materials at Ashland Works.AK Steel Holding Corp. announced that a new recycling facility has been constructed at its Ashland, Kentucky Works to process and recycle waste materials from the plant's blast furnace, cokemaking operation and continuous caster.The new facility is capable of recycling up to 250,000 tons of waste per year and recovering iron and carbon units that would otherwise be sent to a landfill.Waste materials processed in the recycling facility are transformed into a product called cold-bonded briquettes.The briquettes will be used as feedstock for the Ashland Works blast furnace which produces iron as a first step in the steelmaking process.The use of briquettes as a feedstock will significantly reduce the amount of purchased raw materials needed for the Ashland Works ironmaking operation.
